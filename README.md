PowerShell-helpers
==================

Humble PowerShell functions to support simple scripts.

Ideas / Roadmap
---------------

Below are some ideas for this, my inaugural github repo. These are just
intended for possible use in scripts that I write, so I can follow the
DRY principle. At the outset, I have no expectation that these functions
will be useful to anyone else, but you are free to browse and decide for
yourself.

### DateTime to String

*TO DO:* Create trivial functions for easily converting between DateTime
objects and strings. A prime use case would be for use in automatically
naming files with a date stamp format that I prefer, such as YYYYMMDD.

It is probable that these functions are redundant and entirely unnecessary.
If this proves to be the case, then hopefully I will at least have gotten
some good PowerShell practice in the course of learning.

### Excel utilities

*TO DO:* Create functions for creating and manipulating spreadsheets.
(Microsoft Office required.)

### PDF-related utilities

*TO DO:* Create functions for working with PDF files.

### CMS tools

*TO DO:* Interact with content management systems via web services/APIs.
